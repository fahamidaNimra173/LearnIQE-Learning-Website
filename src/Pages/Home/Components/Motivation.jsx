          When Thomas Edison was a young boy, his teacher told him he was too stupid to learn anything. Later, he was fired from his first two jobs for being "non-productive." Despite more than 1,000 failed attempts at inventing the light bulb, Edison never gave up. When asked about those failures, he said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." His perseverance gave the world light â€” both literally and metaphorically. Sp never stop Learning!
