# 📘 LearnIQ

LearnIQ is an educational web platform built with the vision of **making education accessible and discoverable for everyone**. While hundrads of free learning resources exist online, many learners never benefit from them simply because they don’t know where to find them. LearnIQ solves this problem by bringing multiple learning platforms together in one place and providing a demo learning ecosystem where anyone can teach and learn.

## 🌍 Vision & Purpose

Education should be **free, accessible, and easy to explore**.

There are countless free and affordable learning platforms such as **Khan Academy, Udemy, Alison, Ten Minute School, Ostad**, and many more. However, learners often struggle to discover these resources. LearnIQ acts as a **central hub** that helps users explore learning platforms and courses easily.

In addition, LearnIQ includes a **demo learning management system (LMS)** that simulates a real-world online education platform.
