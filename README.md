# 📘 LearnIQ

LearnIQ is an educational web platform built with the goal of **making education easy to discover and accessible for everyone**. Although thousands of free learning resources exist online, many learners fail to use them simply because they don’t know where to find them. LearnIQ brings multiple learning platforms together in one place to solve this problem.

In addition, LearnIQ provides a **demo Learning Management System (LMS)** where users can experience real-world online learning and teaching.
